## CFA Fast Track Term 2 Major Project

Fund it forward brings together crowdsourcing donations for social causes and the idea of "paying it forward".

Requests are posted in the form of "projects", and are funded by people looking to donate.

Once projects are fully funded, 10% of the funds go towards another project of the requester's choice.

It turns the act of passively receiving donations into an active act of giving back and feeding back into the community and the causes which you support.

It allows people who donate to see not only the projects they have funded, but all the other projects they have indirectly helped.
